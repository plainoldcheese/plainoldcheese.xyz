        lets you challenge your friends or race random people online, it has a
        cool graphic with little cars. its also a great real world test since
        all of its text comes from quotes, songs, books, movies and more.

        Is a minimalist alternative to monkeytype. It uses the same wordlists
        but has no account features or stats. I love to use it to warm up before
        doing a few rounds on monkeytype (This way my stats don't tank if I
        haven't practiced in a while.)
