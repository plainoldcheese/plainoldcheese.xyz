- 0.5 tsp garlic powder (optional)

## Directions

1. add all ingredients into mason jar except the oil
2. add oil gently, try not to make the oil mix
3. using the immersion blender, try to "catch" the egg yolks in the cup of immersion blender.
4. blend! slowly pull up as the eggs emulsify the oil, once all the oil has been emulsified stop the blender (do not over blend as you could cook the eggs and cause it to split and be nasty)
