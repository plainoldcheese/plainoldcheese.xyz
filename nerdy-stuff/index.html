		<h1>nerdy stuff</h1>

		<h2>text editor</h2>
		<img src="vim_on_fire.gif" alt="vim logo on fire">
		<p>while I was still on macOS I became fascinated by all the terminal applications that linux users were using. I decided to go thorugh <pre>vimtutor</pre> and teach myslef vim and I havent looked back since.</p>

		<h2>operating system</h2>
		<img src="linux.gif" alt="">
		<p>On my laptop I use arch linux (or gahnoo plus linocks as RMS might say) maybe I use it because I feel like it gives me more control, maybe it just facinates me, maybe it makes me feel like a hacker, or maybe I just want to feel like neo from the matrix. I'll never know.</p>

		<h2>computer hardware</h2>
		<h1>keebs! (and by keebs I mean keyboards of course)</h1>
		<img src="keyboard.gif" alt="">
		<p>I have recently fallen down the rabbit hole that is custom (or even customized) mechanical keyboard. I find it extremely facinating! all the layouts people use (like dvorak colemak and even some custom) and custom form factors (like ortholinear and ergonomic.)</p>
		<p>I am currently using a Geek GK61 optical mechanical 60% keyboard with gateron reds. I did the bandaid mod to quieten the stabilizers and have replaceed the stock abs keycaps with some cool sideprinted pbt keycaps.</p>

		<h2>programming languages</h2>
		<p>I am no programming whizz but I get by. below are listed all the programming languages I am comfortable with. In order of profficiency.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Python</li>
		<li>C</li>
		<li>Shell</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>document formatting/creation</h2>
		<p>as a studetn I am often required to make reports or notes. I use LaTeX for serious reports that require equations and need to be in a specific format. I am lucky enough that my department provides LaTeX templates for use in reports. LaTeX also makes referencing extremely simple. when I am just making notes I store these as plaintext files using the markdown format. I find it to be just the right level of syntax to be functional while still being readable in plaintext. I have also been experimenting with groff and may use it next time I have an individual report, or have to type something a little less equation and image heavy.</p>
		<h2>other cool programs</h2>
		<h3>syncthing</h3>
		<img src="computer_e-mail.gif" alt="">
		<p><a href="https://syncthing.net/">syncthing</a> is an amazing program that runs on mac, windows, linux and even android. it allows you to sync folders across devices using a local network. it comes with some basic file history feautures and a simple web interface that you can access by navigating to <pre>http://localhost:8384/</pre> in your browser.</p>
