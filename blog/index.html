        <h3>the future will be technical</h3>
        <time>30-03-2021</time>
        <blockquote>"Oh of course, you were on twitter for longer than an hour, what do you expect?  Whenever I want to use the internet, I set up two timers to make sure I go no longer than 20 minutes, and I keep a post-it on my computer that says 'You are not broken'.  It's ridiculous that you don't!"</blockquote>

        <h3>new stuff</h3>
        <time>30-03-2021</time>
        <p>added a moodboard to the website. basically a lofi pinterest clone. i tried to use only named html colors like lavender, peru, aliceblue, etc.</p>

        <h3>simple html > simple css</h3>
        <time>29-03-2021</time>
        <p>i think i would rather make some css with complicated selectors than add tons of divs with classes and id's into my html. if the html is simple it makes managing the content easier. complicated css is only a problem when you want to change how the content looks which is (hopefully) less often than changing/updating the content</p>

        <h3>link collector</h3>
        <time>29-03-2021</time>
        <p>i am like a hoarder of urls. i just keep copying and pasting them into text files and organizing and saving them for later. but i think i spend more time searching for links to save than i do reading my saved links.</p>

        <h3>what's the point</h3>
        <time>22-03-2021</time>
        <p>
          sometimes i wonder "what's the point of caring about all this privacy, federation, decentralization, anti-monopoly stuff?"
        </p>
        <p>
          very few people i know in real life care at all and i often feel disconnected from friends because i'm not on instagram or tik tok or whatever.  it also doesn't seem like my efforts are going to do anything to the "big tech" situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          maybe i can carry on caring about this stuff just because it is cool and not for any deeper meaning.  i'm not sure if i would be able to go back to using big tech's services knowing how they try to manipulate users and profit off of people's personal information.

          at least having my own website is fun!

        <time>18-03-2021</time>
        <p>last.fm is exactly what i was missing in my music discovery experience, its a shame i couldn't manage to save my old account but maybe that's a good thing? i listen to very different music now than i did back when i was scrobbling in high school.</p>

        <h3>renting a vps?</h3>
        <time>17-03-2021</time>
        <p>currently this site is hosted through github pages, but i'm starting to think that my needs are growing beyond a simple static site. I would like to add a place to hold comments like a guestbook and it would be nice to be able to have more dynamic pages or host some other stuff like an image board. right now there's not really that much content but i like to experiment.</p>

        <time>23-02-2021</time>
        <p>
          at first i thought this game looked bad and overly complicated, but
          decided to give it a try. man, am i hooked! i've clocked in over 30
          hours in my first week with only 2 colonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          i'm having quite a lot of fun, especially considering that i haven't
          really been able to enjoy video games/movies/music in a while. it's
          complicated but you pick it all up quite naturally as you go along and
          i haven't yet felt overwhelmed the experience reminds me very much of
          being glued to the glowing crt playing age of empires as a kid.
