        <h3>last.fm</h3>
        <time>18-03-2021</time>
        <p>last.fm is exactly what i was missing in my music discovery experience, its a shame i couldn't manage to save my old account but maybe that's a good thing? i listen to very different music now than i did back when i was scrobbling in high school.</p>

        <h3>renting a vps?</h3>
        <time>17-03-2021</time>
        <p>currently this site is hosted through github pages, but i'm starting to think that my needs are growing beyond a simple static site. I would like to add a place to hold comments like a guestbook and it would be nice to be able to have more dynamic pages or host some other stuff like an image board. right now there's not really that much content but i like to experiment.</p>

          best survival crafting game i've ever played! the bosses and raids
          keep you motivated and on your toes, and the base building is superb!

          at first i thought this game looked bad and overly complicated, but
          decided to give it a try. man, am i hooked! i've clocked in over 30
          hours in my first week with only 2 colonies.
        </p>

          i'm having quite a lot of fun, especially considering that i haven't
          really been able to enjoy video games/movies/music in a while. it's
          complicated but you pick it all up quite naturally as you go along and
          i haven't yet felt overwhelmed the experience reminds me very much of
          being glued to the glowing crt playing age of empires as a kid.
