        <p><b>2021-03-16</b> styled the blog, cleanup other junk and fix links</p>
        <p><b>2021-03-17</b> added cooking site inspired by <a href="https://based.cooking">based.cooking</a>. I pretty much stole the css. Also testing out using AJAX for fake dynamic sites.</p>
        <p><b>2021-03-17</b> The site will be undergoing some serious renovations, mostly cleanup and trying to reuse more style sheets instead of having a css file for every single page. also thinking about hosting the site on a vps or moving over to neocities.</p>
        <p><b>2021-03-17</b> more cleanup, added a page to access all the startpages that i have made.</p>
        <p><b>2021-03-22</b> added contact page</p>
        <p><b>2021-03-22</b> cheese</p>
        <p><b>2021-03-30</b> make all pages mobile friendly (except this page, if you read changelogs on a phone then you probably don't care about css anyway. enjoy your raw vegan html)</p>
