            <h3>The Zen of Tending to Your Very Own Digital Garden</h3>
            <p>As a child you play in the garden. As a teenager you largely ignore the garden. As an adult you try to cultivate the garden, and as an elder you experience the garden once again as a child.</p>

            <p>As a newbie on the internet everything is novel and exciting, but as we come to know it for what it is and not what it could be we become somewhat jaded. Treating your own website like a garden is a way to help reignite that feeling of "surfing the net", exploring and imagining the endless possibilities that it can bring.</p>
            
            <p>It creates a space for expression and play and gives us a way to shape and control the way people experience and interact with us online. Whether you treat it like a fine bonzai, pruning and shaping it to be the best version of itself, or you prefer to treat it like a vegetable patch planting crops and harvesting them in seasons only to plant completely different crops next. Being in control of the information you put online and how it is experienced is both empowering and freeing.</p>

            <p>So welcome to my garden. I hope that you stay a while and that you can relax and enjoy the scenery.</p>
